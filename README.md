## 💡 Project Overview  
Efficient water management is one of the biggest challenges in modern agriculture. Our solution uses soil moisture sensors and wireless communication to automate irrigation, conserve water, and improve crop yields. The system is affordable, portable, and scalable, making it ideal for smallholder farmers.

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **Smart Automation:** Automatically irrigates based on soil moisture levels.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Tracks soil conditions and system status via sensors.  
- **Wireless Communication:** Connects multiple sensor nodes to a central module for seamless operation.  
- **Scalability:** Easily expandable for larger farms by adding more sensor nodes.  
- **Portability:** Designed with compact modules and solar-powered components for field deployment.

## 🛠️ System Architecture  
1. **Sensor Nodes (ESP32):** Measure soil moisture and transmit data wirelessly.  
2. **Central Module (ESP32):** Receives sensor data, processes it, and controls irrigation.  
3. **Cloud Integration:** (Planned) Enables remote monitoring and control via a web dashboard or mobile app.  
4. **Power Supply:** Uses solar-powered, battery-operated modules for energy efficiency.

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Soil moisture sensors connected to ESP32 nodes gather data from the field.  
2. The nodes send this data wirelessly to a central ESP32 module.  
3. The central module processes the data and decides whether to activate the water pump using a relay.  
4. (Future Development) Data will be uploaded to the cloud for real-time monitoring and remote control.

## 📋 Future Work  
- **Web Dashboard and Mobile App:** For remote monitoring and control.  
- **Advanced Sensors:** Integrate temperature, humidity, and other sensors for detailed analytics.  
- **Energy Optimization:** Improve solar and battery management for extended field use.  
- **Scalability Testing:** Deploy and test in larger, real-world agricultural fields.
